Neural   Style Transfer

# Task-5: Neural Style Transfer

In this task, I implemented **Neural Style Transfer**, a deep learning technique that blends the **content of one image** with the **artistic style of another**. This technique uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to create visually artistic and stylized outputs.

## 🔍 Objectives
- Understand how content and style representations are extracted using CNNs
- Apply the style of a painting or artwork to a content image
- Use pre-trained VGG models to compute loss and optimize output

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- PyTorch / TensorFlow
- Matplotlib, PIL
- Google Colab

## 📁 Contents
- `neural_style_transfer.ipynb` – Main implementation notebook
- `content/` – Folder with content images
- `style/` – Folder with style images
- `output_images/` – Stylized output images

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open `neural_style_transfer.ipynb` in Google Colab
2. Upload your content and style images
3. Run the notebook to generate stylized output

## 🎨 Sample Result
> **Content Image:** A city skyline  
> **Style Image:** Starry Night by Van Gogh  
> **Output:** A city skyline painted in the style of Starry Night

## 📌 Outcome
Successfully created stylized images by combining visual features of two distinct sources. This task enhanced my understanding of **CNNs**, **feature extraction**, and **artistic AI applications**.
